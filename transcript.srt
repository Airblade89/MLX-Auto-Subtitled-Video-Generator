Hello!

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,700
Hello Juan!

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
What are you doing?

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,300
Look, this is the plan for my new apartment.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm looking where I'm going to accommodate my new furniture.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,800
Do you like it?

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,100
Yes, it's a very big apartment, but I don't understand it, do you explain it to
me?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Yes, of course, it's big for me, but you will like it a lot.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Look, this is the entrance and here is a small bathroom.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Bathroom.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Here is a living room with its TV and in the background is a small balcony.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Next to it is the first room.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,100
How many rooms does your apartment have?

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,100
My apartment has two rooms. This room is the room for visits.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,100
And this one is my room.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Your room is much bigger than the one you visit.

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Yes, my room has its bathroom and also has its closet.

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
It's very pretty.

21
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
And what else is there?

22
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Look, in front of the first room is the kitchen.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:18,100
It's also very big. I already have a refrigerator, a stove and a small table for
the center.

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Look, here is the dining room next to the kitchen.

25
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
And this?

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,100
This is what I like the most about my new apartment.

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
It's my garden.

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Wow, it's a very big garden.

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Yes.

30
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Your entire apartment is very big.

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:57,100
It has an entrance, a bathroom, a living room, a balcony and it has two rooms.

32
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:07,100
The small room is for visits and the larger room is for a bathroom and a closet.

33
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:15,100
In front of the room for visits is the kitchen and on the side is the dining
room.

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,100
And also my favorite part is the garden.

35
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Yes, the garden is very big.

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:30,100
And I would like you to help me to see what plants I can plant in my new garden.

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Of course, I would also like to help you with the change.

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes, it would be perfect.

39
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Great.

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
Oh, I love it.
