 Hello!

00:10.200 --> 00:11.700
 Hello Juan!

00:11.700 --> 00:13.300
 What are you doing?

00:13.300 --> 00:19.300
 Look, this is the plan for my new apartment.

00:19.300 --> 00:25.300
 I'm looking where I'm going to accommodate my new furniture.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.800
 Do you like it?

00:26.800 --> 00:34.100
 Yes, it's a very big apartment, but I don't understand it, do you explain it to
me?

00:34.100 --> 00:39.100
 Yes, of course, it's big for me, but you will like it a lot.

00:39.100 --> 00:47.100
 Look, this is the entrance and here is a small bathroom.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.100
 Bathroom.

00:51.100 --> 01:03.100
 Here is a living room with its TV and in the background is a small balcony.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.100
 Next to it is the first room.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.100
 How many rooms does your apartment have?

01:17.100 --> 01:26.100
 My apartment has two rooms. This room is the room for visits.

01:30.100 --> 01:34.100
 And this one is my room.

01:36.100 --> 01:40.100
 Your room is much bigger than the one you visit.

01:40.100 --> 01:51.100
 Yes, my room has its bathroom and also has its closet.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
 It's very pretty.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.100
 And what else is there?

01:58.100 --> 02:05.100
 Look, in front of the first room is the kitchen.

02:05.100 --> 02:18.100
 It's also very big. I already have a refrigerator, a stove and a small table
for the center.

02:18.100 --> 02:29.100
 Look, here is the dining room next to the kitchen.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.100
 And this?

02:31.100 --> 02:36.100
 This is what I like the most about my new apartment.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.100
 It's my garden.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.100
 Wow, it's a very big garden.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.100
 Yes.

02:42.100 --> 02:46.100
 Your entire apartment is very big.

02:46.100 --> 02:57.100
 It has an entrance, a bathroom, a living room, a balcony and it has two rooms.

02:57.100 --> 03:07.100
 The small room is for visits and the larger room is for a bathroom and a
closet.

03:07.100 --> 03:15.100
 In front of the room for visits is the kitchen and on the side is the dining
room.

03:15.100 --> 03:20.100
 And also my favorite part is the garden.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.100
 Yes, the garden is very big.

03:22.100 --> 03:30.100
 And I would like you to help me to see what plants I can plant in my new
garden.

03:30.100 --> 03:35.100
 Of course, I would also like to help you with the change.

03:35.100 --> 03:38.100
 Yes, it would be perfect.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.100
 Great.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.100
 Oh, I love it.

03:40.100 --> 03:46.100
